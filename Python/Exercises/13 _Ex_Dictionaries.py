# create a variable and assign it a dictionary that has 5 key value pairs
var = {"book" : "pen", "charger" : "phone", "key" : "locker", "land" : "house", "gov" : "public"}

#print and access the value held at the third key in the dictionary
print(var["key"])

#use the in keyword to check if a key appears in the dictionary and print the result
print("road" in var)

#use not in to check if a key does not appear in the dictionary and print the result
print("road" not in var)
